-think about an modular controller set with configuration management
-cleanup and review of all jdoc comments




#Performace conclusion

1. Class initialization - no problem after startup phase - all components got cached
2. Component config path iteration!


#component path retrieval problem
1.Split config run
component initialization could be devided into two runs, child component aggregation and config aggregation
+config tree is first ready and can matched against an cached diff of the config,
	maybe component wise. So components in the tree can individually initialized and rendered.
	We can call this subtree updates.
-config is not so flexible, component tree can't be generated dynamicly

2. pre aggregate the config also into an component tree each config node containing only its note passing it one to one to the config
